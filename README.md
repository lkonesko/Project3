"# Project3" 

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
This project was all about item tracking of items in a provided .txt document. There were three seperate scenarios to solve including counting the number of reoccurences, being able to produce a histogram for the number of reoccuring items, and finally to be able to list data for a specific item provided by the user.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I felt like I did particularly well swapping the user data between c++ and python using the provided tools. I also felt like I did well at completing a decent level of input validation for this project.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
I feel there are a number of areas where I could enhance my code. If I had more time then I would probably look for ways to enhance the interface and output section, I also believe there is some more input validation I could work on to account for different lists on seperate .txt documents

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
The piece of code that I found the most challenging was the user input validation section. I found it more challenging to access and scan the .txt document in c++ than in Python.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
Skills that will be particularly transferable to other projects will likely be being able to incorporate multiple languages. I am interested to see the various language combinations that are to come.
